# Revisiting Data Structure

I want to do a daily update on this document, so that I can relearn all the data structure in classes and their types. Because I have learn programming for atleast 5 years, I am always skeptical of my own ability and understanding on them. It is just like I know how they looklike, and I have a picture in the mind. But it is always like having a `know it all` attitude, but never trying to write from scratch repeatedly, or try to compete with the speed of STL of most languages, and not truly improving from there.

4 languages will be choosen for implementation `Python3`, `Python2`, `JavaScript`, `Java` and `C++`. 

I will also try to give more documents on how people have implemented it better, from libraries of extension on the data structure, and the methods that rivals STL.

## Data Type

In most language the default available data types are:
1. `integer`
2. `string`
3. `character`
4. `float\double`
5. `pointers`

|type|language|size|initialization|
|--|--|--|--|
|`integer`|`Python`|unlimited||
|`string`|:aa:|
|`character`|:aa:|
|`float`|:aa:|
|`dobule`|:aa:|
|`pointers`|:aa:|


Char Unicode non Unicode conversion.
Integer Bitwise operations.
Pointers tricks.
How to mutate a string, 


## Data Structure

Most data are stored in a list/array. Which is usually applied to data with same type of data-type
