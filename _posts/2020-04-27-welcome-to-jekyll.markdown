Hello, this is my first time using Jekyll! I have found a template from <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/" target="_blank">JekyllThemes</a> called **<a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/mundana-jekyll-theme/" target="_blank">Mundana</a>**. Feel free to grab it for yourself and start blogging!!

There is few hope I want to plant into this blog:
1. I want to note down my **Competitive Coding** progress and hopefully discuss some problems
2. I want to organise my **school** and log my progress in **work**
3. I want to keep a records of **useful tools** that I came across and hopefully able to use it in the blog in the future.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
